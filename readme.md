Quantum Embedding Compression

A revolutionary universal method for embedding compression:
- Reduces dimensionality **256+ times**.
- Saves up to **99.6% storage**.
- Speeds up inference ×100.
- Includes a “chaos” mode: controlled noise for stress-testing robustness.

Benefits
- Cuts data center costs (energy, storage, GPU).
- Enables AI deployment on airplanes, drones, and IoT devices.
- Privacy-friendly: anonymized embeddings without user linkage.
- Eco-friendly: less carbon footprint, less hardware

Problem: Modern embeddings = huge storage and GPU farms. Expensive, slow, unsuitable for edge devices.

Solution: New embedding storage and processing format:
- 1536 → 12 dimensions
- 99.6% storage savings
- 100× faster inference & search

Target Markets:
- Cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- Aviation & aerospace
- Fintech & healthcare
- Social networks & marketplaces

Business Model:
- SaaS subscription
- License (% of savings)
- Enterprise contracts
